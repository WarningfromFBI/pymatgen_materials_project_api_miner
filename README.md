# api_miner
series of functions to mine the Materials Project Battery Explorer as well as the materials database
note that to use these scripts, you must have an account on Materials Project (free) so you can generate your own MAPI key
(if you find my MAPI key on my scripts, please let me know)
(see scripts API Miner)

## mining the api extracted data
there is an additional set of functions which further mines the raw database to generate features and labels
for battery machine learning
